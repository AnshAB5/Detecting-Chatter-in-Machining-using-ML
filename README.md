# Detecting-Chatter-in-Machining-using-ML
This project focused on detecting machining chatter using a ResNet50 CNN and a mathematical model. Time and frequency domain analyses, including FFT, were applied to acceleration data. The mathematical model incorporated factors like Peak-Peak Value, RMS, and Variance. OpenCV was used for image preprocessing, enhancing the dataset for CNN training.
